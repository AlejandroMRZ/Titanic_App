# Titanic Survival Prediction and AI Explanation

This project combines Machine Learning (ML) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict and explain survival outcomes for passengers aboard the Titanic disaster. It leverages logistic regression for prediction and integrates Google AI Gemini for historical context explanations.

## Features

1. **Machine Learning Model**: A logistic regression model predicts whether a Titanic passenger survives or not based on:
   - **Sex**
   - **Age**
   - **Passenger Class**

2. **AI Integration**: Google AI Gemini provides contextual, historical explanations for the model's survival predictions, helping to understand the reasons behind the outcomes.

3. **Web Application**: The entire system is deployed using Flask, making it accessible through a user-friendly interface.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and preprocess Titanic passenger data.
   - Handle missing values for "Age" and categorize "Sex" and "Passenger Class" for the ML model.

2. **Model Training**
   - Train a logistic regression model using labeled Titanic passenger data.
   - Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics.

3. **Prediction**
   - Input passenger details through the Flask interface (e.g., "Sex", "Age", "Class").
   - The logistic regression model predicts survival probabilities.

4. **AI Explanation**
   - The prediction outcome ("Survived" or "Not Survived") is sent to Google AI Gemini.
   - Gemini provides historical explanations based on socio-economic and Titanic-related events to justify the outcome.

5. **Web Rendering**
   - Flask renders the app, allowing users to input data, see survival predictions, and view AI-generated explanations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-ml-ai.git
   cd titanic-ml-ai
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Google AI Gemini API key:
     ```
     GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
     ```

4. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Access the app in your browser:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## Usage

1. Input passenger details ("Sex", "Age", "Passenger Class") through the Flask web form.
2. View survival predictions ("Survived" or "Not Survived").
3. Read historical explanations generated by Google AI Gemini for the prediction.

### Example

**Input**: Female, 24 years old, 1st Class  
**Prediction**: Survived  
**AI Explanation**:  
*"Based on Titanic records, women in first class had the highest survival rates due to the 'women and children first' evacuation policy."*

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate additional features (e.g., "Embarked", "Fare").
- Improve AI explanations by adding more contextual historical details.
- Optimize the ML model for better accuracy.
- Deploy the app to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud).
